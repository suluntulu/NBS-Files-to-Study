Hello! Looks like you've come here to either study or steal NBS songs.

FYI, please don't steal, it's not nice, and it does not advance your skills! It's better to study the songs and try to create a new song on your own!
Some songs here are incomplete and (at least I think) have potential, if you want, you can work on them as you please and maybe upload it to the nbs-creations channel in the server and ping me there!

If you have any questions about NBS or composing in general, feel free to DM me!

I have no idea nor the time on how to license/protect this music so please just play by honor.
