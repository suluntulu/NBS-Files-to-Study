In the "beforeTheSort" file, some songs are the template songs that NBS comes prebuilt in. So yeah lol. My bad, it is (almost) every song in my songs folder (around 99.7%)
This is practically every single song i've worked on - ever.

There may also be some cover songs I did. If I remember correctly, there is a Ben's "Megido Apocalypse: Seize the Moment", Ben Diablo's "An Enigmatic Encounter", 
Toby Fox's "BIG SHOT", YOASOBI's "Idol", Laura Shigihara's "Graze the Roof", Malaysia's National Anthem, XavierEXE's "11", "9", "5", "2" and "1", Europe's 
"The Final Countdown" among some other songs. I do not claim to own any of them for that, the Creative Commons License covers every song and creation to all songs 
besides (but not limited to) the songs I have covered, whether I am aware of it or not.

Also, sorry if you had to unzip so many files. I just had no time to upload each of them individually, theres about a thousand files. It is safe, I promise.
